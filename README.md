## Abstract
A multi-layer image is more valuable than a single-layer image from a graphic designer's perspective.
However, most of the proposed image generation methods so far focus on single-layer images.
In this paper, we propose MontageGAN, which is a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework for generating multi-layer images.
Our method utilized a two-step approach consisting of local GANs and global GAN.
Each local GAN learns to generate a specific image layer, and the global GAN learns the placement of each generated image layer.
Through our experiments, we show the ability of our method to generate multi-layer images and estimate the placement of the generated image layers.
